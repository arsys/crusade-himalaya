					<p class="heading-wrapper uk-padding-remove uk-align-center"><strong>Why Nepal?</strong></p>

					<p>Nepal as a destination often surpasses a visitor&#39;s expectations &ndash; the lush green plains to the world&#39;s tallest mountain, &nbsp;dense jungles to arid valleys, glacial lakes to raging rivers, diverse culture and their lives, to experience Nepal is one of the most exhilarating experience one can indulge in. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Although constituting &nbsp;a reasonably finite geographical area, the experiences one can indulge in this nation are infinite. Paradise like landscapes, pristine peaks, a day of solitude and yet the next day with adventure, the intertwining of history and modernity &ndash; these are only some of the facets of Nepal. To truly understand and fully comprehend the vastness of Nepal, one has to visit the nation.</p>
