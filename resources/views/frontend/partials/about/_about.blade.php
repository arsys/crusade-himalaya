				Nepal isn't a destination, it is an experience; 
				an experience beyond the ordinary.
				Why Nepal?
				Nepal as a destination often surpasses a visitor's expectations – the lush green plains to the world's tallest mountain,  dense jungles to arid valleys, glacial lakes to raging rivers, diverse culture and their lives, to experience Nepal is one of the most exhilarating experience one can indulge in.   
				Although constituting  a reasonably finite geographical area, the experiences one can indulge in this nation are infinite. Paradise like landscapes, pristine peaks, a day of solitude and yet the next day with adventure, the intertwining of history and modernity – these are only some of the facets of Nepal. To truly understand and fully comprehend the vastness of Nepal, one has to visit the nation.
